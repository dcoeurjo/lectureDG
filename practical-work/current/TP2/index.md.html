**TP2: Image Filtering and Bilateral Filter**

In this TP, we will implement image enhancing and filtering techniques. 
Please refer to the GitHub project for the materials.

# Gaussian convolution

1. Implement a simple averaging filter that just average the pixel values in a given 3x3 or 5x5 neighborhood (in RGB space, just average each channel).

2. Implement a Gaussian filter that can be parametrized  by the kernel standard deviation $\sigma$. Remember, the Gaussian filter being separable, only a 1D filter is needed here.

3. Observe the filtering results on the cat while increasing the $\sigma$.


Alternative implementations: [Recursive Gaussian Filters](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9d4e/6116a699d1d37b06152fb538ef2b5d7b4bc1.pdf), FFT + pointwise multiplication + invFFT.

# Bilateral Filter

The idea now is to implement a bilateral filter:
$$
  I^*(x) = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{y \in \Omega_x} I(y)f(|I(y)-I(x)|)g(\|y-x\|),
$$
with

* $W= \sum_{y\in \Omega_x}{f(|I(y)-I(x)|)g(\|y-x\|)}$;
* $\Omega_x$ is a window around $x$;
* $f$ and $g$ are decreasing functions $[0,+\infty]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^+$.

In the context of this TP, both $f$ and $g$ will be (halves of) Gaussian kernels.

1. Is the bilateral filter separable?
2. Provide a direct implementation of the bilateral filter and use it on the noisy cat.
3. A fast implementation of the bilateral filter has been proposed by [#Chen], please have a look to the paper. The basic idea is to transform the anisotropic bilateral filter into a simple Gaussian filtering in higher dimensions. Using the separable Gaussian filter you may already have, implement such approach and compare its performances with respect to the direct implementation.
